# DPCIPI Cross-immunity Prediction
This repository mainly shares the dataset and code of antigenic effect prediction with model DPCIPI.
## Binary Cross-immunity Prediction
HI_predict_by_year folder saves the excutable models for the prediction of binary cross-immunity.
## Multi-level Cross-immunity Prediction
HI_4_predict_by_year folder saves the excutable models for the prediction of multi-level cross-immunity.
## Original Data
The original data is saved in original_DNA folder, it consist of gene accession number we collected from NCBI.
## Supplementary Materials 
Supplemenntary materials folder saves the 2472 original HI results referece to Smith's work and 55128 undocumented assay result predictions.
